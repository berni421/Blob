    <string name="intro_welcome">Welcome\n\nA demonstration of object motion, collision and accretion.</string>
    <string name="intro_welcome2">The application starts with a set of small mass objects moving in random directions. These tend to collide and bounce away from each other. Clicking on the screen places some heavy objects. These heavy objects can have so much gravitational force that other objects stick when they collide. A slider is provided to vary the gravitational forces.</string>

    <string name="howto">Use the slider to adjust gravity for all objects.\n\nClick to place some massive objects on screen.</string>
